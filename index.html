    c programming was introduced by <b>"danish ritche"</b> in 1970 at bell labs.At the early 
    there was only assembly language.Which is not <b> portable </b>and not flexible.There were some
    high level languages but they were &nbsp; too slow . &nbsp;Dennis ritchie wanted a powerful,fast and 
    portable language to write the UNIX operating system.portable means it can run on different 
    computers with little change.<br>To provide good balance between machine level control and human
    readability.
